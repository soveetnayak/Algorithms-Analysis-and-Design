One of the most important topics in DSA is sorting and searching. One of the most prevalent uses of computers nowadays is for storing and retrieving data.&#x20;

The quantity of data and information kept and accessed by computers has grown over time, resulting in massive databases. To properly manage and handle information in databases, a plethora of approaches and algorithms have been created.



**The most common searching algorithms are:**

{% content-ref url="linear-search.md" %}
[linear-search.md](linear-search.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="binary-search.md" %}
[binary-search.md](binary-search.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="interpolation-search.md" %}
