# Hamiltonian Path/Cycle Problem

Hamiltonian Path in an undirected graph is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian Path such that there is an edge (in the graph) from the last vertex to the first vertex of the Hamiltonian Path. Determine whether a given graph contains Hamiltonian Cycle or not. If it contains, then prints the path. Following are the input and output of the required function.\
_Input:_ \
A 2D array graph\[V]\[V] where V is the number of vertices in graph and graph\[V]\[V] is adjacency matrix representation of the graph. A value graph\[i]\[j] is 1 if there is a direct edge from i to j, otherwise graph\[i]\[j] is 0.\
_Output:_ \
An array path\[V] that should contain the Hamiltonian Path. path\[i] should represent the ith vertex in the Hamiltonian Path. The code should also return false if there is no Hamiltonian Cycle in the graph.\
For example, a Hamiltonian Cycle in the following graph is {0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 0}.

```
(0)--(1)--(2)
 |   / \   |
 |  /   \  | 
 | /     \ |
(3)-------(4)
```

And the following graph doesnâ€™t contain any Hamiltonian Cycle.

```
(0)--(1)--(2)
 |   / \   |
 |  /   \  | 
 | /     \ |
(3)      (4) 
```

**Naive Algorithm** \
Generate all possible configurations of vertices and print a configuration that satisfies the given constraints. There will be n! (n factorial) configurations.

```
while there are untried conflagrations
{
   generate the next configuration
   if ( there are edges between two consecutive vertices of this
      configuration and there is an edge from the last vertex to 
      the first ).
   {
      print this configuration;
      break;
   }
}
```

**Backtracking Algorithm** \
Create an empty path array and add vertex 0 to it. Add other vertices, starting from the vertex 1. Before adding a vertex, check for whether it is adjacent to the previously added vertex and not already added. If we find such a vertex, we add the vertex as part of the solution. If we do not find a vertex then we return false.
