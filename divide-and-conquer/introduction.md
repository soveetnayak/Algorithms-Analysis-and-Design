# Introduction

Divide and conquer (D\&C) is an algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more subproblems of the same or related type until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the subproblems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
