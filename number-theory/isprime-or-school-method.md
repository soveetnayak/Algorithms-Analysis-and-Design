# IsPrime | School Method



Given a positive integer, check if the number is prime or not. A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Examples of first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, \
**Examples :** \
&#x20;

```
Input:  n = 11
Output: true

Input:  n = 15
Output: false

Input:  n = 1
Output: false
```

&#x20;

**School Method** \
A simple solution is to iterate through all numbers from 2 to n-1 and for every number check if it divides n. If we find any number that divides, we return false. \


```
// A school method based C++ program to check if a
// number is prime
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std; 
bool isPrime(int n)
{    
// Corner case    
if (n <= 1)  
return false;     
// Check from 2 to n-1    
for (int i=2; i<n; i++)        
if (n%i == 0)            
return false;     
return true;} 
// Driver Program to test above function
int main()
{    
isPrime(11)? cout << " true\n": cout << " false\n";
isPrime(15)?  cout << " true\n": cout << " false\n";
return 0;
}
    
```

**Output :** \
&#x20;

```
true
false
```

Time complexity of this solution is O(n)\


**Optimized School Method** \
Instead of checking till n, we can check till âˆšn because a larger factor of n must be a multiple of smaller factor that has been already checked.
